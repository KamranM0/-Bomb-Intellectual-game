# "Bomb" intellectual game.
## Game description
It is an intellectual where 2 teams consisting of 5 players compete with each other, by answering the questions correctly and in a short amount of time. After the round starts, so-called 'bomb' gets attached to a randomly selected player from each team, and team players try to find the PIN code of the bomb to rescue their teammates. If they find the answer both on time and correctly, bomb doesn't explode. In other cases, bomb explodes, and one player on whom the bomb is attached cannot participate in the next round.
